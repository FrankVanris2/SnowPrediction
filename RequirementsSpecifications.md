<h2> Introduction </h2><br><br>

**1.1 Problem statement**<br><br>
*To improve upon lack lustered predictions of next day snow fall.*<br><br>

**1.2 Summary**<br><br>
*To help and benefit the users in a way where the data is valid and that we can easily predict snow fall and give data immediately to the user with no problems. We also care about improving the users experiene when it comes to retrieving data and seeing the data projected to them.*<br><br>

**<h3>1.3 Product Scope</h3>**<br><br>
**1.3.1 In scope**<br>
* *user will be able to access data within an interface and see predicted data of current day information about snow fall.*<br>
* *An example would be when a user wants to go to snowqualmie pass to ski but doesn't know how snowy it is, or if it's going to snow more the next day. They can use this software to check the predicted growth in snow if there will be snow growth to see if tomorrows a good day to ski.*<br><br>

**1.3.2 Out of scope**<br><br>
* *Checking the outcomes of monthly data & seasonal data will not meet the requirements for this software.*<br>
* *Accessing past data from countless years for predictions will not meet the requirements for this software.*<br>
* *An app used within a mobile device will not meet the requirements for this software.*<br><br>
