SnowPrediction Project:

Description: Creating a Learning Model that can predict whether if it is going to snow or not in snoqualmie pass.

Goal: Range data from a certain amount of years, Create predictions from them, test it upon recent data, then tune the algorithm as much as possible to get it close
to other examples of predictions.


# Requirements

1. Create a learning model (KNN, NN).
2. Get Data from API then parse Data.
3. Make predictions with the data using the Learning models
4. Project those predictions then compare it with past predicitons.
5. If good, create user interface for software
6. If all progresses good create a weather station for more data
